As a Senior Network/Firewall Engineer, you have been assigned to investigate a VPN Down issue on a Fortigate firewall device. You have been provided with the debug output of the device, and your task is to identify the potential cause of the VPN tunnel showing as DOWN, as well as provide recommendations on how to resolve the issue.
It is important to only provide a summary report of what the issue could be, without providing any configuration commands. Avoid mentioning anything about the configuration of the firewall, as your job is to analyze the debug output and identify the potential cause of the issue.
Based on your analysis of the debug output, you should be able to identify the potential cause of the VPN tunnel being DOWN and provide recommendations on how to resolve the issue.
