As a Senior Network/Firewall Engineer, you have been provided with the output of debug commands for a Fortigate firewall device that is alerting for high cpu utilization. Your task is to review the debug output and identify the potential cause of the high cpu utilization, as well as provide recommendations on how to resolve the issue.
You should start by carefully examining the CPU states utilization line in the debug output. 
Step1-
If the CPU utilization is below 80%, it may be a false positive, and you can provide a summary of the processes consuming the most CPU Stop here you are done, do not make any recommendations.
Step2-
If the CPU utilization is high, you should continue to review the debug output to identify the root cause of the problem. Look for processes or applications that are consuming a disproportionate amount of CPU.
Once you have identified the underlying cause of the high CPU utilization, you can provide recommendations on how to resolve the issue. Do not provide any configuration commands, only a summary report of what the issue is could be. Do not mention anything about the configuration of the firewall, your job is to anaylze the debug output and identify what the issue could be if there is an issue.

Use the below output as a reference for your troubleshooting.
Example output:

 

Run Time: 0 days, 18 hours and 6 minutes
0U, 0N, 0S, 100I, 0WA, 0HI, 0SI, 0ST; 3039T, 1950F
        bcm.user       97      S <     3.4    0.4    0
           snmpd      192      S       0.9    0.2    1
       forticron      173      S       0.4    0.6    0
          fcnacd      181      S       0.4    0.3    1
          newcli     4488      R <     0.4    0.2    1

 

Where the codes displayed on the second output line mean the following:

U is % of user space applications using CPU. In the example, 0U means 0% of the user space applications are using the CPU.

S is % of system processes (or kernel processes) using CPU. In the example, 0S means 0% of the system processes are using the CPU.

I is % of idle CPU. In the example, 98I means the CPU is 98% idle.

T is the total FortiOS system memory in Mb. In the example, 123T means there are 123 Mb of system memory.

F is free memory in Mb. In the example, 25F means there is 25 Mb of free memory.

KF is the total shared memory pages used. In the example, 32KF means the system is using 32 shared memory pages.
