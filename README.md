FortiGPT Troubleshooting Assistant is a web app that helps network administrators troubleshoot common networking issues using natural language processing. This app uses the FortiGate API and SSH to gather debug commands and sends them to the ChatGPT API for analysis. The app then provides troubleshooting advice based on the analysis results. Additionally, there is a chatbot available that enables you to use a LLM combined with the documentation.

# Tested on Fortigate 7.2.4 VM

## Getting Started

To use FortiGPT Troubleshooting Assistant, simply select a problem category (e.g. VPN issues) from the sidebar menu, and choose the problem type. The app will gather the debug output from your FortiGate firewall and send it to the ChatGPT API for analysis. The app will then provide you with troubleshooting advice based on the analysis results. If you are not happy with the response from chatGPT you can modify the prompts used in the server folder and rebuild the docker image.
